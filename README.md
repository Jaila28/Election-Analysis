Election Analysis

Project Overview

In this Analysis, I was asked by an Election Board Employee named Tom to assist in an election audit of Tabulated results for Congressional Precinct in Colorado. I was asked to report the following below:

*Total number of votes cast
*A complete list of candidates who received votes
*Total number of votes each candidate received
*Percentage of votes each candidate won
*The winner of the election based on popular vote

##Challenge Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to extract additional data for the Congressional Precinct in Colorado so that they could have more of a better understanding of the 
initial election analysis. The additional information that was added is the percentage and totals amounts of the votes that were from each county. The Board of directors Tom needed to get a better insight on how many people submitted a ballot for each candidate in each county.

##Challenge Summary

In conclusion of the Analysis I was able to discover that out of the 369,711 votes, Jefferson county submitted the second highest amount of ballots which makes up 10.5 percent of the total in the amount of 38,855 votes. Arapahoe county came in 3rd place, which makes up for 6.7 percent of the ballots submitted. Denver County came in 1st place with the highest amount of ballots submitted.  Denver county residents submitted a total of 306,055 ballots which makes up 82.8 percent of the total. Overall each county submitted the most ballots for the candidate Diana DeGette who won the elelction with a total of 272,892 votes which make up 73.8 percent fo the total. 

This code can be used to give more details such as how many people from each county submitted a votes for each individual. I personally would have liked to provide more demographic information so that I could have given a better understanding where each candidate was favored and not favored in each county.
